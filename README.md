# Component Library 
## Purpose 
The Purpose of this project was to create a component library of commonly used components including: buttons, thumbnails, and forms. Now, users have access to an array of components that can be reused and modified for varius websites. The design of the components are based on entirely from mockups. 


## Deployed Site 

My website can be accessed [here](https://agitated-austin-92807a.netlify.com/?path=/story/button--primary) on netlify. 

## Built Using

## Accessing the Library

The components can be previewed [here](https://agitated-austin-92807a.netlify.com/?path=/story/button--primary)

## About the Project 
This project was my introduction to both Storybook and using the react framework. The biggest challenge was transitioning from my understanding of how to manipulate elements using the DOM and OOP to manipulating elements using components instead. Overcoming this challenge allowed me to create components with modifiable styles and functonality. 

## Future Directions 
My goal is to continue to add to components to this library over time so that I can continue to use these components in future projects. I also plan to continue to improve the functionality of the existing components as well.
